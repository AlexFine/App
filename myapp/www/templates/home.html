                <p><b>Who we are: </b>Whether communicating with family or catching up with friends, technology has become an ever important field of communication in our community and in our world today. With this increasing importance, many people, especially senior citizens, lag behind and form what is known as the "digital divide." Technology has and will continue to prove as a hindrance to senior citizens wishing to stay connected to loved ones until the problem is solved. Technocademy, Inc. is a nonprofit organization that provides fun and educational seminars free of charge to residents in participating senior living centers throughout the Atlanta area. Lessons include various topics on technology, ranging from Intro to Computers, to Basics of Email, Cell Phone Boot Camp, to Facebook and Social Media. The Technocademy, Inc. teams travel directly to interested senior living centers and independently sets up and takes down as necessary. We focus on providing the kind of lessons most beneficial for senior citizens, combining a unique methodology of 1-on-1 training and a classroom setting. In each format, we adapt to ensure the needs of our senior citizens are being met. Technocademy, Inc. through its innovative Summer Seriesâ„¢, is all about allowing senior citizens to communicate with friends and family around the world through the use of technology. It was started in 2012 by Josh, a high school student at Alpharetta High School. His goal is to spread Technocademy, Inc.'s mission:<b> promoting digital literacy and awareness across the United States.</b></p>
